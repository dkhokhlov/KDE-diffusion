Releases
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾

Steps to take when releasing a new version:
• Bump version number and enter current date in `__init__.py`.
• Add a dedicated commit for the version bump.
• Tag the commit with the version number, for example: `git tag -a v0.9.0`.
• Enter the change log relative to the previous release as an annotation.
• Push the commit (but not the tag): `git push origin main`.
• Check that documentation built successfully on Read-the-Docs.
• Publish to PyPI by running `deploy/publish.py`.
• Check that meta information is correct on PyPI.
• Then push the tag: `git push --tags`.
• Publish the new release on GitHub with the change log.
